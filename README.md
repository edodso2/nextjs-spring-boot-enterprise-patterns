# Next.js and Spring Boot Enterprise Patterns

This blog series is targeted at Full Stack Software Engineers interested in using the most popular enterprise frameworks. Regardless of personal opinions and trends Spring Boot continues to rain supreme in backend enterprise while React positions itself to be the entprise standard on front end for years to come with Next.js quickly emerging as the all in one framework for React, similar to how Spring Boot did for Java a few years ago. 

This repository will contain a basic monorepo containing a backend user microservcie service and a front end administration console that utilizes the user service to manage users.

## Branches

Each branch of this repository will focus on a specific enterprise pattern such as caching, code generation, etc.
